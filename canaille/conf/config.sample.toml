#
# A 'FILTER' parameter that is a LDAP filter used to determine if a user
# belongs to an access control. If absent, all the users will match this
# access control. If your LDAP server has the 'memberof' overlay, you can
# filter against group membership.
# Here are some examples
#     FILTER = 'uid=admin'
#     FILTER = 'memberof=cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=mydomain,dc=tld'
#
# The 'PERMISSIONS' parameter that is an list of items the users in the access
# control will be able to manage. 'PERMISSIONS' is optionnal. Values can be:
# - "edit_self" to allow users to edit their own profile
# - "use_oidc" to allow OpenID Connect authentication
# - "manage_oidc" to allow OpenID Connect client managements
# - "manage_users" to allow other users management
# - "manage_groups" to allow group edition and creation
# - "delete_account" allows a user to delete his own account. If used with
#                    manage_users, the user can delete any account
# - "impersonate_users" to allow a user to take the identity of another user

# The 'READ' and 'WRITE' attributes are the LDAP attributes of the user
# object that users will be able to read and/or write.
