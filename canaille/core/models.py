    This attribute is intended to be used as a means to set, replace,
    or compare (i.e., filter for equality) a password.  The cleartext
    value or the hashed value of a password SHALL NOT be returnable by
    a service provider.  If a service provider holds the value
    locally, the value SHOULD be hashed.  When a password is set or
    changed by the client, the cleartext password SHOULD be processed
    by the service provider as follows:

    *  Prepare the cleartext value for international language
       comparison.  See Section 7.8 of [RFC7644].

    *  Validate the value against server password policy.  Note: The
       definition and enforcement of password policy are beyond the
       scope of this document.

    *  Ensure that the value is encrypted (e.g., hashed).  See
       Section 9.2 for acceptable hashing and encryption handling when
       storing or persisting for provisioning workflow reasons.

    A service provider that immediately passes the cleartext value on
    to another system or programming interface MUST pass the value
    directly over a secured connection (e.g., Transport Layer Security
    (TLS)).  If the value needs to be temporarily persisted for a
    period of time (e.g., because of a workflow) before provisioning,
    then the value MUST be protected by some method, such as
    encryption.

    Testing for an equality match MAY be supported if there is an
    existing stored hashed value.  When testing for equality, the
    service provider:

    *  Prepares the filter value for international language
       comparison.  See Section 7.8 of [RFC7644].

    *  Generates the salted hash of the filter value and tests for a
       match with the locally held value.

    provider in any form (the attribute characteristic "returned" is
