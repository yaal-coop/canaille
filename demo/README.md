# Demo and development

To check out how canaille looks like, or to start contributions, just run it!

- If you have *OpenLDAP* installed on your system, run: `./run.sh`.
- If you prefer using docker, you can also run `docker-compose up`.

Then you have access to:

- A canaille server at http://127.0.0.1:5000
- A dummy client at http://127.0.0.1:5001
- Another dummy client at http://127.0.0.1:5002

The canaille server has some default users:

- A regular user which login and password are *user*;
- A moderator user which login and password are *moderator*;
- An admin user which admin and password are *admin*.
