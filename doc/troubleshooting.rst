The web interface throws unuseful error messages
================================================

Unless the current user has admin permissions, or the installation is in debug mode, error messages won't be too technical.
For instance, you can see *The request you made is invalid*.
To enable detailed error messages, you can **temporarily** set the ``DEBUG=true`` configuration parameter.
